In this module we configration the properties through @Value, Environment, @ConfiguredProperties.
And configure the Spring Boot profiles.
Externalize configuration using command line, JVM, environment options.
Use the Spring cloud config -> central server where we store our all configration properties.(accounts, loans, cards)
We have one more microservice configserver.
Store properties files in -> classpath, file system, github repo.
Then use the actuator-> For refresh

For refresh at runtime-> use spring cloud bus -> Use RabbitMq and Use the webhooks (hookdeck mediator for webhooks).

Make docker image of each microservice using google jib.
